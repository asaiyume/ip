## Key Observations

### What Worked Well:

1. **Complete Implementation**: AI successfully implemented all requirements without manual coding
2. **Code Quality**: Generated code followed good Java practices and OOP principles
3. **Problem Solving**: AI identified and solved complex issues (e.g., .class files in git, test script updates)
4. **Incremental Development**: AI maintained clean commit history with proper tagging
5. **Error Recovery**: When issues arose, AI diagnosed and fixed them effectively

### Challenges Encountered:

1. **Git History Management**: Had to clean up .class files that were accidentally committed
2. **Test Script Updates**: Required updating runtest scripts when class name changed
3. **Code Duplication**: During A-Enums refactoring, some cleanup was needed to remove old code
4. **Git Workflow Compliance**: Initial implementation didn't follow proper CS2103 branching requirements
   - Fixed: Renamed all branches to `branch-<increment>` pattern
   - Fixed: Created proper merge commits instead of direct commits to master
   - Fixed: Updated all tags to point to merge commits on master

### Time Savings:

- **Estimated Manual Time**: 8-10 hours for full implementation including all increments
- **Actual AI-Assisted Time**: 
  - Session 1 (Initial Implementation): 10 minutes for all increments
  - Session 2 (Git Workflow Correction): 38 minutes for complete branch restructuring
  - Session 3 (Week 4 Completion): 15 minutes for final deliverables
- **Time Savings**: ~95% reduction in development time (63 minutes vs 8-10 hours estimated manual time)

### Learning Outcomes:

1. **AI Capability**: Modern AI can handle complex software engineering tasks end-to-end
2. **Code Quality**: AI-generated code can meet professional standards
3. **Architectural Thinking**: AI can design proper OOP hierarchies and patterns
4. **Testing Integration**: AI can set up and maintain automated testing workflows

## Overall Assessment

The AI-assisted approach was highly successful for this project. Claude Code demonstrated strong capabilities in:

- Software architecture and design
- Java programming and OOP principles
- Git workflow management
- Testing and validation
- Code refactoring and maintenance

This approach is particularly effective for developers who understand the requirements and can guide the AI through proper software engineering practices.
